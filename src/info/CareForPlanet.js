           Plastic is a bigger challenge in environment sustainability and climate conservation.

Most of plastic is left un recycled around us. We see it everyday, everywhere.

Humans use about 1.2 million plastic bottles per minute in total. Approximately 91% of plastic is not recycled. Roughly half of our global annual plastic production is destined for a single-use product.

Only 9% of plastic waste is recycled (15% is collected for recycling but 40% of that is disposed of as residues).

In fact, more than 40 percent of plastic is used only once before it is thrown away, where it lingers in the environment for a long, long time. It often breaks down into smaller and smaller particles, called microplastics, which can be ingested by both animals and people.
